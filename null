# View quotas \(old version\)

This topic describes how to view your current privileges and resource quotas in the ECS console. You can apply to increase your resource quota if the current resource quota is insufficient.

Your privileges and resource quotas may change based on the usage of your ECS resources.

If your Privileges & Quotas page is not consistent with that described in this topic, see [View and increase quotas \(new version\)](/intl.en-US/Tag & Resource/Resource/Privileges & Quotas/View and increase quotas (new version).md).
