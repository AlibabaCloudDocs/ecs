# What is Asynchronous Block Storage Replication?

Asynchronous Block Storage Replication \(ABSR\) is a block-level feature for asynchronous replication of cloud disks. It asynchronously replicates data on a cloud disk within one region to a cloud disk in another region. ABSR provides data protection and resumes services when an exception occurs on a primary disk, to reduce or prevent data losses and ensure service continuity for key data.

## Features

ABSR allows you to replicate cloud disks to other regions to implement geo-disaster recovery of data. After a replication relationship is created and activated, data on a primary disk is asynchronously replicated to a secondary disk on a regular basis. Users do not need to create any snapshots. For example, when a user needs to copy a cloud disk from one region to another region, Â only needs to create a cloud disk at the opposite region in and create a replication pair.

ABSR is supported between the following regions:

-   ABSR is supported between the China \(beijing\), China \(Shanghai\), and China \(Heyuan\) regions.
-   ABSR is supported between the US \(Silicon Valley\) and US \(Virginia\) regions.

## Terms

The following terms are used in ABSR:

-   Asynchronous replication: Data on a cloud disk within one Alibaba Cloud region is asynchronously replicated to a cloud disk within another region based on a specific cycle.
-   Primary disk: the cloud disk whose data is to be replicated. The primary disk is also called the source disk.
-   Secondary disk: the destination disk to which data is replicated.
-   Recovery point objective \(RPO\): the amount of data that may be lost due to a failure. RPO is measured by time. For example, if the RPO is 1 hour, all the data written to the cloud disk within the last hour is lost when the disk becomes unavailable.
-   Recovery time objective \(RTO\): the duration of time within which a business system is restored after a disaster. For example, if the RTO is 1 hour, the service is restored within 1 hour after a disk becomes unavailable.
-   Replication relationship: the replication relationship established between the primary disk, secondary disk, and replication configurations.

## Usage specifications

|Specification|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|The maximum number of replication relationships that can be created for an account within a single zone|32|
|The number of replication relationships that can be created for a cloud disk|1|
|Minimum replication cycle|15 minutes \(replication is automatically performed every 15 minutes\)|
|Category of the primary disk|Data disks that are enhanced SSDs \(ESSDs\)|
|Category of the secondary disk|Cloud disks of the same category and with the same capacity as the primary disk|

After an replication relationship is created for a cloud disk, some features of the cloud disk is limited. The following table describes these limits.
