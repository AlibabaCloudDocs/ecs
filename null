# What is Dedicated Block Storage Cluster?

Dedicated Block Storage Cluster is a block storage service that offers physical isolation and allows you to exclusively use the entire block storage cluster.

## Features

A dedicated block storage cluster is a block storage cluster in which you have exclusive use to the physical resources. As the only user of the block storage cluster, you do not need to share its physical resources with other users. In addition, you can view the performance monitoring information and exception information of the cluster.

Unlike public cloud block storage clusters, dedicated block storage clusters offer physical isolation and exclusive resources. Within a dedicated block storage cluster in the destination zone, you can create a disk and attach the disk to existing ECS instances \(including dedicated hosts\). Other users are not able to use this cluster.

**Note:** The Dedicated Block Storage Cluster feature is now available only in the China \(Heyuan\) and Indonesia \(Jakarta\) regions. The number of supported regions is increasing.

## Scenarios

Dedicated block storage clusters are physically isolated from other public cloud block storage clusters. After you purchase a dedicated block storage cluster, you can exclusively own the cluster. The Dedicated Block Storage Cluster feature is suited for the industries such as finance, healthcare, and government that have strict requirements on data security.

## Limits

The following table describes the limits of the Dedicated Block Storage Cluster feature.

|Item|Description|
|----|-----------|
|Cluster capacity|-   Minimum capacity: 60 TiB
-   Incremental capacity: 12 TiB

**Note:** The cluster capacity can only be increased by an increment of 12 TiB, and cannot be customized.

-   Maximum capacity: 1,020 TiB |
|Disk type|Only enhanced SSDs \(ESSDs\) of the PL1 performance level can be created.For more information about PL1 ESSDs, see [Enhanced SSDs](/intl.en-US/Block Storage/Block Storage overview/Enhanced SSDs.md). |
