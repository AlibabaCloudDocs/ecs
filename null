# Enable ABSR

This topic describes how to enable ABSR to synchronize cloud disk data to other regions.

ABSR is supported between the following regions:

-   ABSR is supported between the China \(beijing\), China \(Shanghai\), and China \(Heyuan\) regions.
-   ABSR is supported between the US \(Silicon Valley\) and US \(Virginia\) regions.

In a replication relationship, the primary disk is a data disk that is an enhanced SSD \(ESSD\), and the primary disk cannot be a secondary disk in another replication relationship. The secondary disk is a cloud disk that has the same specifications and capacity as the primary disk. Each cloud disk \(primary or secondary disk\) can have only a single replication relationship.

The following table describes the limits on the primary and secondary disks after a replication relationship is configured.

|Item|Support for the primary disk|Support for the secondary disk|
|----|----------------------------|------------------------------|
|Read and write operations|Yes|No|
|Deletion|Yes|No|
|Re-initialization|No|No|
|Resizing|No|No|
|Attachment|Yes|No|
|Snapshot creation|Yes|Yes|
|Performance type modification|No|No|

## Create a replication relationship

To use the ABSR feature, you must create a replication relationship first.

1.  Go to the Asynchronous Block Storage Replication page.

    1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com).

    2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Storage & Snapshots** \> **Asynchronous Block Storage Replication**.

    3.  In the top navigation bar, select a region.

2.  Click **Create Asynchronous Block Storage Replication**.

3.  In the **Select Source Resource to Replicate** step, configure the parameters for the primary disk. Then, click **Next: Create Destination Resource**.

    The following table describes the parameters to configure for the primary disk.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |Region and Zone|Select the region and zone of the primary disk to replicate.|
    |Primary Disk|Select the primary disk to replicate.|

4.  In the **Create Destination Resource** step, create a secondary disk. Then, click **Create Disk**.

    The following table describes the parameters to configure for the secondary disk.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |Destination Region and Zone|The destination region and zone of the secondary disk.|
    |Billing Method|Select the billing method of the secondary disk.|
    |Disk Name|Specify the name of the secondary disk|
    |Tags|Configure the tag key and value of the secondary disk You can use tags to manage disks.|
    |Terms of Service|Read and select Terms of Service.|

5.  In the **Create Replication Relationship** step, configure the parameters described in the following table. Then, click **Next: Preview**.

    |Parameter|Description|
    |---------|-----------|
    |Name|Specify a name for the replication relationship.|
    |Description|Specify a description for the replication relationship.|
    |Minimum Synchronization Cycle|Specify a minimum synchronization cycle for asynchronous replication. Data in the primary disk is synchronized to the secondary disk based on the minimum synchronization cycle.|

6.  In the **Preview** step, confirm the information about the primary disk, secondary disk, and replication relationship. Then, click **Confirm Order**.


## Activate the replication relationship

After a replication relationship is created, you must activate it before asynchronous replication can be performed.

1.  In the left-side navigation pane, Choose **Storage & Snapshots** \> **Asynchronous Block Storage Replication**.

2.  Find the replication relationship that you want to activate and click **Activate** in the Actions column.

    After the replication relationship is activated, data on the primary disk is asynchronously replicated to the secondary disk based on the specified cycle.
