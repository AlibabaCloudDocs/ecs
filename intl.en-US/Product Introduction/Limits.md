# Limits

This topic describes the limits on Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) and how to apply for extensions on the limits.

## Overview

ECS has the following limits:

-   You cannot install virtualization software such as VMware Workstation or use ECS instances for secondary virtualization. Only ECS bare metal instances and Super Computing Clusters \(SCCs\) support secondary virtualization.
-   ECS does not support sound card applications.
-   External hardware devices such as hardware dongles, USB flash drives, external hard disks, and hardware tokens cannot be directly attached to ECS instances. Software verification methods such as two-factor authentication and dynamic passwords can be used.
-   ECS does not support multicast protocols. We recommend that you use unicast protocols instead.
-   Log Service does not support 32-bit Linux ECS instances.

    For more information about the ECS instances that support Log Service, see [Logtail overview](/intl.en-US/Data Collection/Logtail collection/Overview/Logtail overview.md).

-   To apply for ICP filings for websites that are deployed on your ECS instance, make sure that the instance meets ICP filing requirements. You can apply for only a limited number of ICP filing service numbers for each ECS instance. For more information, see [Prepare and check the instance and access information]().

## Public bandwidth limits

Starting from November 27, 2020, the maximum bandwidth available for you to create ECS instances or change the configurations of ECS instances is subject to throttling policies within your account. If you want to raise the maximum bandwidth, [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/console.htm). The following throttling policies apply:

-   Within a single region, the sum of actual peak bandwidths of all ECS instances that use the pay-by-traffic billing method for network usage cannot exceed 5 Gbit/s.
-   Within a single region, the sum of actual peak bandwidths of all ECS instances that use the pay-by-bandwidth billing method for network usage cannot exceed 50 Gbit/s.

|Item|Limit|Adjustable|
|:---|:----|:---------|
|Maximum inbound bandwidth per instance|-   If the purchased maximum outbound bandwidth is less than or equal to 10 Mbit/s, Alibaba Cloud allocates an inbound bandwidth of 10 Mbit/s.
-   If the purchased maximum outbound bandwidth is greater than 10 Mbit/s, Alibaba Cloud allocates an inbound bandwidth that is equal to the purchased maximum outbound bandwidth.

|N/A|
|Maximum outbound bandwidth per instance|-   Subscription instance: 200 Mbit/s
-   Pay-as-you-go instance: 100 Mbit/s

|N/A|
|Changes to the assigned public IP address of an instance|The public IP address of an instance can be changed within 6 hours after the instance is created, and can be changed a maximum of three times.|N/A|

**Note:** When the **pay-by-traffic** billing method for network usage is used, the maximum inbound and outbound bandwidths are both the upper limits of bandwidths and for reference only. In scenarios where demands exceed resource supplies, the peak bandwidth values may be limited. If you want guaranteed bandwidths for your instance, use the **pay-by-bandwidth** billing method for network usage.

## Security group limits

|Item|Limit on basic security groups|Limit on advanced security groups|
|----|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|Security groups of an instance|You can view the resource quota in the ECS console1. For more information, see [View and increase resource quotas](/intl.en-US/Tag & Resource/Resource/Privileges & Quotas/View and increase resource quotas.md).|The limit is the same as that on basic security groups.|
|Classic network-type ECS instances that can be contained in a classic network-type security group|1,000â‘¡|The classic network is not supported.|
|VPC-type ECS instances that can be contained in a VPC-type security group|It depends on the number of private IP addresses that can be contained in the VPC-type security group.|No limits apply.|
|Security groups to which an ECS instance can belong|5 You can submit a ticket to raise the limit to 10 or 16 security groups.

|The limit is the same as that on basic security groups.|
|Security groups to which an elastic network interface \(ENI\) of an ECS instance can belong|
|Inbound and outbound rules in a security group|200â‘¢|The limit is the same as that on basic security groups.|
|Inbound and outbound rules in all security groups to which an ENI belongs|1,000|The limit is the same as that on basic security groups.|
|Private IP addresses that can be contained in a VPC-type security group|2,000â‘£|65,536|
|Internet access port|The default SMTP port for outbound traffic is Port 25 and is disabled by default. The port cannot be enabled by configuring security group rules.|The limit is the same as that on basic security groups.|

-   â‘  The following regions share the quota for security groups that can be created within each account: China \(Hangzhou\), China \(Shanghai\), China \(Qingdao\), China \(Beijing\), China \(Shenzhen\), China \(Hong Kong\), US \(Silicon Valley\), and Singapore \(Singapore\). A maximum of 100 security groups can be created in all of these regions within an account.
-   â‘¡ If more than 1,000 classic network-type instances need mutual access over the internal network, you can assign them to multiple security groups and authorize mutual access among these security groups.
-   â‘¢ If you increase the quota for security groups to which an ECS instance can belong, the quota for rules in each security group decreases. The product of the quota for security groups to which an ECS instance can belong and the quota for rules in each security group cannot exceed 1,000. For example, if the quota for security groups to which the ECS instance can belong is 5, 10, or 16, the corresponding quota for rules in each security group is 200, 100, or 60, as verified by using the following formulas: 5 Ã— 200 = 1000, 10 Ã— 100 = 1000, and 16 Ã— 60 â‰¤ 1000.

    If prefix lists are referenced in security group rules, the maximum entry capacity of the prefix lists counts towards the quota for security group rules. For example, the maximum number of entries that a prefix list can support is 100. If the prefix list is referenced in a security group, the prefix list counts as 100 rules for the security group regardless of the number of existing entries in the prefix list.

-   â‘£ If more than 2,000 private IP addresses need mutual access over the internal network, you can distribute the ECS instances of these private IP addresses to multiple security groups and authorize mutual access among these security groups.
