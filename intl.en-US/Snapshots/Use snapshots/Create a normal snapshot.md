# Create a normal snapshot

A snapshot is a backup file of the data on a disk for a specific point in time. A snapshot is used for data backup, data recovery after accidental instance releases, data recovery after network attacks, and the creation of custom images. You can create snapshots of disks to improve fault tolerance for operations before you roll back a disk, modify key system files, or change the operating system of an instance. This topic describes how to create a normal snapshot in the ECS console or by calling an API operation in Alibaba Cloud CLI.

-   The ECS instance must be in the **Running** or **Stopped** state.
-   The disk must be in the **In Use** or **Expired** state.

    **Note:** If a disk in the **Expired** state reaches its scheduled release time when a snapshot is being created for the disk, the snapshot in the **Creating** \(Creating\) state will also be released together with the disk.


It takes you several minutes to create a normal snapshot, and the specific duration of time depends on the size of the disk. The first snapshot of a disk is a full snapshot, so creating the first snapshot takes an extended period of time. Creating subsequent snapshots takes less time, but the duration of time depends on the amount of data changed since the last snapshot. The more that has changed, the longer it will take.

Take note of the following points when you create a snapshot:

-   You must not perform operations that change the state of the ECS instance such as stopping or restarting the instance.
-   Snapshots are billed resources. For more information, see [Snapshots](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing items/Snapshots.md).
-   We recommend that you create snapshots during off-peak hours because snapshot creation degrades the I/O performance of disks by up to 10% and lowers data read/write speeds.
-   While snapshots are being created, incremental data generated by operations on disks will not be included in the snapshots.
-   If you create an extended volume from a single multi-partition disk, the snapshot that you created can be used to roll back the disk.
-   When a disk is used to create a dynamic extended volume or RAID array, we recommend that you stop applications from writing data to the dynamic extended volume or RAID array and refresh the cached data to the disk. Stop all I/O operations before you create a snapshot.
-   Created snapshots are permanently stored unless you delete them. We recommend that you delete unnecessary snapshots at regular intervals to prevent extra fees incurred by snapshot storage.

## Create a normal snapshot from the ECS console

The following operations demonstrate how to create a snapshot for an instance from the **Instances** page in the ECS console:

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Instances & Images** \> **Instances**.

3.  In the top navigation bar, select a region.

4.  Find the ECS instance for which you need to create a snapshot, click the instance ID, or click **Manage** in the **Actions** column.

    ![Manage](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/4665319951/p9505.png)

5.  The **Instance Details** tab appears. Click the **Cloud Disk** tab.

6.  Find the disk and click **Create Snapshot** in the Actions column.

    **Note:** You can also select appropriate values for headers of the disk list such as **Disk Category \(All\)**, **Status \(All\)**, and **Type \(All\)** to quickly find the disk.

    ![Disk type](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8734736061/p4530.png)

7.  In the dialog box that appears, enter a snapshot name, bind a tag, and then click **Create**.

    **Note:** You can also create a local snapshot for an Enhanced SSD disk. If you do not select Create Local Snapshot in this dialog box, a normal snapshot is created.

8.  After the **Instance Details** tab appears, click the **Snapshot** tab to view the created snapshot.

You can also choose **Storage & Snapshots** \> **Disks** from the left-side navigation pane of the ECS console to create a snapshot for a disk.

## Create a snapshot by using Alibaba Cloud CLI

1.  Obtain the instance ID.

    -   Method 1: If you have connected to the ECS instance, you can obtain the instance ID from the instance metadata. For more information, see [Metadata](/intl.en-US/Instance/Manage instances/Metadata/Overview.md).

        For example, to query the ID of a Linux instance, run the following command:

        ```
        curl http://100.100.100.200/2016-01-01/meta-data/instance-id
        ```

    -   Method 2: Use Alibaba Cloud CLI to call the DescribeInstances operation to obtain the instance ID.

        ```
        aliyun ecs DescribeInstances --RegionId <TheRegionId> --output cols=InstanceId,InstanceName rows=Instances.Instance[]
        ```

2.  Obtain the disk ID by calling the DescribeDisks operation.

    ```
    aliyun ecs DescribeDisks --RegionId <TheRegionId> --InstanceId i-bp1afnc98r8k69****** --output cols=DiskId rows=Disks.Disk[]
    ```

3.  Call the CreateSnapshot operation to create a snapshot based on a specified disk.

    ```
    aliyun ecs CreateSnapshot --DiskId d-bp19pjyf12hebp******
    ```

    The snapshot creation task is initiated if the following information is returned:

    ```
    {"RequestId":"16B856F6-EFFB-4397-8A8A-CB73FA******","SnapshotId":"s-bp1afnc98r8kjh******"}
    ```

4.  Query the snapshot creation progress by calling the DescribeSnapshots operation.

    ```
    aliyun ecs DescribeSnapshots --RegionId cn-hangzhou --InstanceId i-bp1afnc98r8k69****** --output cols=SnapshotId,Status rows=Snapshots.Snapshot[]
    ```

    If both `"SnapshotId"="s-bp1afnc98r8kjh******"` and `"Status":"accomplished"` are displayed, the snapshot is created.


After you create a snapshot, you can:
