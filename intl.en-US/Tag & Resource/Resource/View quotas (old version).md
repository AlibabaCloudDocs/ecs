# View quotas \(old version\)

This topic describes how to view your current privileges and resource quotas in the ECS console. You can apply to increase your resource quota if the current resource quota is insufficient.

Your privileges and resource quotas may change based on the usage of your ECS resources.

**Note:** The privileges and quotas feature of some accounts have been upgraded to the new version. If your Privileges & Quotas page is not consistent with that described in this topic, see [View and increase instance quotas](/intl.en-US/Tag & Resource/Resource/Privileges & Quotas/View and increase instance quotas.md).

2.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ecs).

3.  In the upper-right corner of the **Overview** page, click **Privileges**.
