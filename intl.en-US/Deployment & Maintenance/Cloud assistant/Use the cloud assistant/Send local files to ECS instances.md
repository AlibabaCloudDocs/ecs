* The ECS instances are in the **Running** (Running) state.

  

* The Cloud Assistant client is installed on the ECS instances. For more information, see [Install the Cloud Assistant client](/intl.en-US/Deployment & Maintenance/Cloud assistant/Configure the Cloud Assistant client/Install the Cloud Assistant client.md).

  

* You can send a file to a maximum of 50 ECS instances in a single API call.

  

* The file to send is no larger than 32 KB in size after it is encoded in Base64.
