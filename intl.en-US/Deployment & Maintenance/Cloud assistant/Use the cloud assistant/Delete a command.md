# Delete a command

You are granted a quota for the number of Cloud Assistant commands per Alibaba Cloud region. To ensure a sufficient command quota, we recommend that you regularly delete commands that are no longer needed.

You can also use the immediate execution feature to create and execute commands without consuming the command quota. For more information, see [Run a command at creation](/intl.en-US/Deployment & Maintenance/Cloud assistant/Use the cloud assistant/Run a command at creation.md).

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Maintenance & Monitoring** \> **Cloud Assistant**.

3.  In the top navigation bar, select a region.

4.  Find the commands that you want to delete and use one of the following methods to delete them:

    -   To delete a single command, click **Delete** in the **Actions** column.
    -   To delete multiple commands at a time, select the commands and click **Delete Command** in the lower part of the Cloud Assistant page.
