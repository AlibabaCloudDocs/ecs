# Cloud disks

Cloud disks are block-level Elastic Block Storage \(EBS\) products provided by Alibaba Cloud for ECS and provide low latency, high performance, high durability, and high reliability. Cloud disks use a distributed triplicate mechanism to ensure 99.9999999% \(nine 9's\) data durability for ECS instances. If service disruptions occur within a zone \(for example, due to hardware failures\), data within the zone is copied to an available disk in another zone to help ensure data availability.

## Disk categories

Cloud disks are classified into the following categories based on their performance:

-   Enhanced SSDs \(ESSDs\): ESSDs are based on the next-generation distributed block storage architecture and the 25 Gigabit Ethernet \(25 GE\) and remote direct memory access \(RDMA\) technologies. Each ESSD has low latency and can deliver up to one million input/output operations per second \(IOPS\). For more information, see [Enhanced SSDs](/intl.en-US/Block Storage/Block Storage overview/Enhanced SSDs.md).

    We recommend that you use ESSDs for scenarios such as online transactional processing \(OLTP\) databases, NoSQL databases, and Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana \(ELK\) log analysis.

-   Standard SSDs: Standard SSDs are high-performance disks that provide consistent high random IOPS and high data reliability.

    We recommend that you use standard SSDs for scenarios such as I/O-intensive applications, small and medium-sized relational databases, and NoSQL databases.

-   Ultra disks: Ultra disks are cost-effective and provide medium random IOPS and high data reliability.

    We recommend that you use ultra disks as system disks or for scenarios such as development and testing.

-   Basic disks: Basic disks are the previous generation of disks and are unavailable for purchase.

For more information about disk performance, see [EBS performance](/intl.en-US/Block Storage/Performance/EBS performance.md).

Cloud disks are classified into system disks and data disks based on their purpose.

-   System disks contain operating systems and can be created only along with instances. The lifecycle of a system disk is the same as that of the instance to which the system disk is attached.
-   Data disks are used to store application data and can be created separately or along with instances.

**Note:** When a cloud disk is created, the disk capacity displayed in the ECS console includes the capacity occupied by the operating system, and the remaining available capacity may be less than the disk capacity displayed in the ECS console. For example, if the capacity of a system disk displayed in the ECS console is 40 GiB, the remaining available capacity may be less than 40 GiB because the operating system occupies some of the disk capacity.

## Limits

A cloud disk can be attached to only one ECS instance in the same zone.

## Billing methods

For more information, see the Pricing tab on the [Elastic Compute Service page](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/ecs#pricing).

Cloud disks support the subscription and pay-as-you-go billing methods. For more information, see [Subscription](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing methods/Subscription.md) and [Pay-as-you-go](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing methods/Pay-as-you-go.md).

-   Cloud disks that are created along with subscription instances or created separately for subscription instances are billed on a subscription basis.
-   Cloud disks that are created along with pay-as-you-go instances or created separately for pay-as-you-go instances are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. Storage capacity units \(SCUs\) can be used to offset the bills of pay-as-you-go disks.

After a cloud disk is created, you can change its billing method. For more information, see [Change billing methods of disks](/intl.en-US/Block Storage/Cloud disks/Change billing methods of disks.md).
