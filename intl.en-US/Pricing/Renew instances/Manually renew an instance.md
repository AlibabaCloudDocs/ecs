# Manually renew an instance

This topic describes how to manually renew a subscription instance. Before a subscription instance is automatically released, you can manually renew the instance to extend its service duration.

When you manually renew an instance, you can extend the period of time to use its Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) resources, but you cannot change its configurations. When you renew an instance, you are charged for the public bandwidth of the instance based on the original base public bandwidth, not based on the temporarily upgraded public bandwidth. For information about how to upgrade the base public bandwidth of an instance, see [Modify the bandwidth configurations of subscription instances](/intl.en-US/Instance/Change configurations/Modify bandwidth configurations/Modify the bandwidth configurations of subscription instances.md).

Options for renewal duration vary based on the number of instances that you select for renewal. For more information, visit the buy page.
