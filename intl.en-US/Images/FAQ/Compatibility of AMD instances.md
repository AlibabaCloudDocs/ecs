# Compatibility of AMD instances

This topic describes the versions of the operating system images that are compatible with AMD instances.

## Background information

AMD instances are new products released by Alibaba Cloud, which are powered by the AMD EPYC TM Zen 2 x86 microprocessor \(code: Rome\). AMD instances provide predictable and consistent high performance and reduce virtualization overhead. The following AMD instance families are available:

-   g6a, general purpose instance family
-   c6a, compute optimized instance family
-   r6a, memory optimized instance family

For more information, see [Instance families](/intl.en-US/Instance/Instance families.md).

AMD instances are compatible with different operating system versions. The AMD Zen architecture was released in 2017. Some new features of the processor on the AMD Zen architecture are not supported by earlier operating system versions. You can determine the operating system version that you need to use based on your applications. The following table lists the recommended versions for mainstream operating systems.
