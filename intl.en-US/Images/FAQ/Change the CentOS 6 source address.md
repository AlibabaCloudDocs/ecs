# Change the CentOS 6 source address

CentOS 6 has reached its end of life \(EOL\), and the Linux community no longer maintains this operating system version. We recommend that you upgrade your operating system to CentOS 7 or later. If you still require some of the installation packages of CentOS 6 during the transition, you can change the CentOS 6 source address for your images as instructed in this topic.

CentOS 6 has reached its EOL on November 30, 2020. In accordance with the community rules of Linux, the content at the source address `http://mirror.centos.org/centos-6/` of CentOS 6 has been removed. All third-party image providers have already removed the CentOS 6 source address. The `http://mirrors.cloud.aliyuncs.com` and `http://mirrors.aliyun.com` source addresses of Alibaba Cloud cannot synchronize with the CentOS 6 source address. If you continue to use the default CentOS 6 source address on Alibaba Cloud, an error is reported. The following figure shows an example of the error.

You can perform the following procedure to change the source address configurations in the ECS instances that run CentOS 6 operating system based on the network environment.

-   YUM repository
    -   For VPC-type instances, you must change the source address of YUM repository to `http://mirrors.cloud.aliyuncs.com/centos-vault/6.10/`.
    -   For classic network-type instances, you must change the source address of YUM repository to `http://mirrors.aliyuncs.com/centos-vault/6.10/`.
-   EPEL repository
    -   For VPC-type instances, you must change the source address of EPEL repository to `http://mirrors.cloud.aliyuncs.com/epel-archive/6/`.
    -   For classic network-type instances, you must change the source address of EPEL repository to `http://mirrors.aliyuncs.com/epel-archive/6/`.

**Note:** This topic describes how to change the CentOS 6 source address in ECS instances. If your server is not an ECS instance, make sure that the server is accessible from the Internet and that the `http://mirrors.cloud.aliyuncs.com` source address is replaced with `http://mirrors.aliyun.com`. For example, if you change the source address of a YUM repository, replace the source address with `http://mirrors.aliyun.com/centos-vault/6.10/`. If you change the source address of EPEL repository, replace the source address with `http://mirrors.aliyun.com/epel-archive/6/`.

1.  Connect to an ECS instance that runs CentOS 6.

    For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Instance/Connect to instances/Overview.md).

2.  Run the following command to modify the `CentOS-Base.repo` file:

    ```
    vim /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo 
    ```

3.  Press the I key to enter the edit mode. Modify the following content to change the source address.

    Modify the file based on the network type of the instance.

    -   VPC

        ```
        [base]
        name=CentOS-6.10
        enabled=1
        failovermethod=priority
        baseurl=http://mirrors.cloud.aliyuncs.com/centos-vault/6.10/os/$basearch/
        gpgcheck=1
        gpgkey=http://mirrors.cloud.aliyuncs.com/centos-vault/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-6
        
        [updates]
        name=CentOS-6.10

        name=CentOS-6.10
        enabled=1
        failovermethod=priority
        baseurl=http://mirrors.cloud.aliyuncs.com/centos-vault/6.10/extras/$basearch/
        gpgcheck=1
        gpgkey=http://mirrors.cloud.aliyuncs.com/centos-vault/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-6
        ```

    -   Classic network

        ```
        [base]
        name=CentOS-6.10
        enabled=1
        failovermethod=priority
        baseurl=http://mirrors.aliyuncs.com/centos-vault/6.10/os/$basearch/
        gpgcheck=1
        gpgkey=http://mirrors.aliyuncs.com/centos-vault/RPM-GPG-KEY-CentOS-6

    ```
    vim /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo
    ```

5.  Press the I key to enter the edit mode. Modify the following content to change the source address.

    Modify the file based on the network type of the instance.
