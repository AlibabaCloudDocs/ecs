# Use Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 images in an on-premises environment

Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 images are available in various formats and have cloud-init built in. These images can be used on premises. This topic describes how to use Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 images in an on-premises environment.

Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 images can run only on kernel-based virtual machines \(KVMs\). Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 images cannot directly start KVMs. You must configure a boot image. In this topic, the on-premises operating system is CentOS. Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 is used to create a KVM, and cloud-init is used to initialize the system settings of the KVM. For more information about cloud-init, visit [Alibaba Cloud \(AliYun\)](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/datasources/aliyun.html?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.24.1bec3fcaonbql3) on the official cloud-init website. The NoCloud data source is used to create on-premises configuration files. After the configuration files are attached to the KVM as a virtual disk, the KVM can be started.

This topic is intended for users who are familiar with KVMs.

## Step 1: Download an Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 image to your on-premises computer

You can download an Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 image to your on-premises computer from the [Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 On-premises Image](https://mirrors.aliyun.com/alinux/image/) page. Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 images are available in the VHD or qcow2 format.

## Step 2: Obtain the seed.img boot image from your on-premises computer

You must configure the network, account, and YUM repository for the boot image. Typically, the image is named seed.img. You can change the name of the image, but we recommend that you do not.

**Note:** The seed.img image contains only the configuration files that are required to start cloud-init. The image does not contain Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 system files.

You can use one of the following methods to obtain the seed.img image:

-   Go to the [Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 On-premise Image](https://mirrors.aliyun.com/alinux/image/) page and click seed.img to download the seed.img image.

    The configuration information in this image cannot be modified, which makes it less ideal for some scenarios. Make sure that you are already familiar with the image before you download it.

-   Perform the following operations to manually generate the seed.img image based on the NoCloud data source.

1.  In an on-premises directory, create two configuration files named `meta-data` and `user-data`.

    1.  Create a directory named `seed` and go to the directory.

        ```
        mkdir seed
        cd seed/
        ```

    2.  Create the `meta-data` configuration file.

        The following example describes the content of the configuration file. You can modify the content.

        ```
        #cloud-config
        #vim:syntax=yaml
        
        local-hostname: alinux-host
        # FIXME: doesn't work for systemd-networkd
        #network-interfaces: |
        #  iface eth0 inet static
        #  address 192.168.122.68
        #  network 192.168.122.0
        #  netmask 255.255.255.0
        #  broadcast 192.168.122.255
        #  gateway 192.168.122.1
        ```

    3.  Create the `user-data` configuration file.

        The following example describes the content of the configuration file. You can modify the content.

        ```
        #cloud-config
        #vim:syntax=yaml
        
        # Create a user named alinux who is authorized to run sudo commands.
        users:
          - default
          - name: alinux
            sudo: ['ALL=(ALL)   ALL']
            plain_text_passwd: aliyun
            lock_passwd: false
        
        # Create a YUM repository for Alibaba Cloud Linux 2.
        yum_repos:
            base:
                baseurl: https://mirrors.aliyun.com/alinux/$releasever/os/$basearch/
                enabled: true
                gpgcheck: true
                gpgkey: https://mirrors.aliyun.com/alinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-ALIYUN

                enabled: true
                gpgcheck: true
                gpgkey: https://mirrors.aliyun.com/alinux/RPM-GPG-KEY-ALIYUN
                name: Aliyun Linux - $releasever - Extras - mirrors.aliyun.com
            plus:
                baseurl: https://mirrors.aliyun.com/alinux/$releasever/plus/$basearch/
                enabled: true
                gpgcheck: true

        # If you use cloud-init or systemd-networkd to configure the network, configurations specified in meta-data may fail. To avoid this problem, you can use the following network configurations:
        write_files:
          - path: /etc/systemd/network/20-eth0.network
            permissions: 0644
            owner: root
            content: |
              [Match]
              Name=eth0
        
              [Network]
              Address=192.168. *. */24
              Gateway=192.168. *.1
        
        # You can also use the following alternative network configurations:
        runcmd:
          - ifdown eth0
          - systemctl restart systemd-networkd
        ```

2.  Install the `cloud-utils` software package on your on-premises computer.

    ```
    yum install -y cloud-utils
    ```

3.  In the `seed` directory, run the following command to generate the `seed.img` image:

    ```
    cloud-localds seed.img user-data meta-data
    ```


## Step 3: Start the KVM

You can use one of the following methods to start the KVM. Then, use the account information in the `user-data` configuration file to log on to the KVM.

-   Use libvirt to start the KVM.
    1.  Create a configuration file in the XML format on your on-premises computer. The sample file is named `alinux2.xml` and contains the following content: You can modify the XML-formatted configuration file.

        ```
        <domain type='kvm'>
            <name>alinux2</name>
            <memory>1048576</memory> <! -- 1 GB of memory -->
            <vcpu>1</vcpu>
            <os>
                <type arch='x86_64'>hvm</type>
                <boot dev='hd'/>
            </os>
            <clock sync="localtime"/>
            <on_poweroff>destroy</on_poweroff>
            <on_reboot>restart</on_reboot>
            <on_crash>restart</on_crash>
            <devices>
                <emulator>/usr/bin/qemu-kvm</emulator><! -- Configure a KVM path based on the operating system. For example, the KVM path for Ubuntu is /usr/bin/kvm -->
                <disk type='file' device='disk'><! -- Specify the type parameter based on the image format. Set type to qcow2 if the image is in the QCOW2 format, and set type to vhd if the image is in the VHD format. -->
                    <driver name='qemu' type='qcow2' cache='none' dataplane='on' io='native'/> <! -- If you want to create a snapshot in the qcow2 format, you must disable dataplane. -->
                    <source file='path'/> <! -- Enter the absolute path of the Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 image. -->
                    <target dev='vda' bus='virtio'/>
                </disk>
                <! -- Add the information of seed.img. -->
                <disk type='file' device='disk'>
                    <driver name='qemu' type='raw'/>
                    <source file='/path/to/your/seed.img'/> <! -- Enter the absolute path of seed.img. -->
                    <target dev='vdb' bus='virtio'/>
                </disk>
                <interface type='network'>
                    <source network='default'/>
                    <model type='virtio'/>
                </interface>
                <console type='pty'>
                    <target type='virtio' port='0'/>
                </console>
                <video>
                    <model type='cirrus' vram='9216' heads='1'/>
                    <alias name='video0'/>
                </video>
                <input type='tablet' bus='usb'/>
                <input type='mouse' bus='ps2'/>
                <graphics type='vnc' port='-1' autoport='yes'/>
            </devices>
        </domain>
        ```

    2.  Run the `virsh` command to start the KVM. Sample command:

        **Note:** By default, libvirt is started by a common user. Make sure that common users have the permissions to manage image files and their paths.

        ```
        virsh define alinux2.xml
        virsh start KVMName    # Enter the actual name of the KVM.
        ```

-   Run the `qemu-kvm` command to start the KVM. You must append the following parameter information to the command. Set the `file` parameter to the actual absolute path of the seed.img image.

    ```
    -drive file=/path/to/your/seed.img,if=virtio,format=raw
    ```
