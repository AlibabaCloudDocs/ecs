# Select an image

This topic describes how to select an appropriate image from multiple image types and operating systems to suit your business needs. You must select an image when you create an ECS instance.

When you select an image, you must consider the following factors:

-   [Region](#section_okd_bqv_hhb)
-   [Image type](#section_9op_qir_5qk)
-   [Image fee](#section_rc2_iv0_l8f)
-   [Operating system](#section_x1t_f35_hhb)
-   [Built-in software](#section_0r4_eja_g94) \(such as MySQL and other applications\)

## Region

Each image is tied to its region and can only be used to create instances within the same region. For example, if you want to create an instance in China \(Beijing\), only images in the China \(Beijing\) region can be used. For more information about regions, see [Regions and zones]().

If you want to use an image that belongs to a different region, you must copy the image to that region. For more information, see [Copy custom images](/intl.en-US/Images/Custom image/Copy custom images.md).

## Image type

ECS images are classified into public images, custom images, shared images, and Alibaba Cloud Marketplace images based on image sources. For more information, see [Image types](/intl.en-US/Images/Image overview.md).

## Image fee

You may be charged for images that you use. For more information, see [Image prices](/intl.en-US/Images/Image overview.md).

## Operating system

When you select an operating system, you must consider the following factors:

-   Operating system architecture: 32-bit or 64-bit

    |Operating system architecture|Applicable memory|Limit|
    |:----------------------------|:----------------|:----|
    |32-bit|A maximum of 4 GiB memory|    -   If the memory of an instance type is greater than 4 GiB, you cannot use a 32-bit operating system.
    -   A 32-bit Windows operating system supports a maximum of four CPU cores. |
    |64-bit|A minimum of 4 GiB memory|If you want to use a memory of at least 4 GiB for your applications, use a 64-bit operating system.|

-   Operating system type such as Windows, Linux, or Unix-like

    |Operating system type|Logon mode|Feature|Scenario|
    |:--------------------|:---------|:------|:-------|
    |Windows|Remote Desktop Connection|A Windows public image is installed with a genuine activated system.|    -   Applicable to programs developed based on Windows architectures such as .NET programs.
    -   Supports SQL Server and other databases \(manual installation required\). |
    |Linux and Unix-like|SSH|    -   A common, stable, and secure server-side operating system.
    -   An open source operating system that provides fast deployment and easy source code compilation.
|    -   Typically used for server applications, such as high-performance web servers, and supports common programming languages such as PHP and Python.
    -   Supports MySQL and other databases \(manual installation required\). |

    Alibaba Cloud provides a list of public images that run the Windows, Linux, or Unix-like operating systems. For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Images/Public image/Overview.md).

-   Considerations for Windows

    We recommend that you use a recent version of Windows. More recent versions of Windows have fewer vulnerabilities than earlier versions. IIS 7.5 provides more features and a more convenient console than IIS 6.

    Read the following considerations and select the suitable hardware configuration and Windows version:

    -   Instance types with one vCPU and 1 GiB memory do not support the MySQL database.
    -   Windows instances that are used for website building and web environment deployment must have at least 2 GiB memory.
    -   To ensure service availability, we recommend that you select an instance type that has at least 2 GiB of memory when you use Windows 2012.
    -   You must select an instance type that has at least 2 GiB of memory if you want to use Windows 2016 or Windows 2019. If your selected instance type has memory of less than 2 GiB, Windows 2016 or Windows 2019 may not be displayed in the public image list on the buy page.
    -   Alibaba Cloud no longer provides technical support for Windows Server 2003 system images. For more information, see [Offline announcement of Windows Server 2003 system images](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/faq-detail/59513.htm).
-   Considerations for Linux and Unix-like operating systems

    Alibaba Cloud Linux and Unix-like public images contain the following distributions:

    -   Alibaba Cloud Linux

        Alibaba Cloud Linux is an operating system that provides a safe, stable, and high-performance runtime environment for applications on ECS instances. Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 supports various cloud scenarios and instance types \(excluding instances of the classic network type and non-I/O optimized instances\). For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Images/Alibaba Cloud Linux 2/Overview.md).

## Built-in software

Alibaba Cloud Marketplace images are typically pre-installed with a runtime environment or software applications. You can purchase appropriate images to create ECS instances based on your actual needs. For more information, see [Alibaba Cloud Marketplace images](/intl.en-US/Images/Alibaba Cloud Marketplace images.md).

## What to do next

-   Use an image to create an ECS instance. For more information, see [Create an instance by using the wizard](/intl.en-US/Instance/Create an instance/Create an instance by using the wizard.md).
-   Use an image to change the operating system. For more information, see [Change the operating system](/intl.en-US/Images/Change the operating system.md).
