# Instance families that support instance type changes

This topic describes the instance types and instance families that support instance type changes. If your current instance type does not meet your business needs, check whether the instance type can be changed. If yes, choose a method to change the instance type.

## Impacts of instance type changes

The impact of an instance type change varies based on the network type of the instance.

-   Classic network-type instances:
    -   For retired instance types, when a non-I/O optimized instance is upgraded to an I/O optimized instance, instance information including the private IP addresses, disk device names, and software license codes are changed. For Linux instances, the device names of basic disks \(`cloud`\) are identified as xvd\* such as `xvda` or `xvdb`, and the device names of ultra disks \(`cloud_efficiency`\) and standard SSDs \(`cloud_ssd`\) are identified as vd\* such as `vda` or `vdb`.
    -   For instance types that belong to an available instance family, the private IP addresses of instances are changed.
-   VPC-type instances:

## Instance families that do not support instance type changes

The following instance families do not support instance type changes across instance families or within the same instance family:

-   Big data instance families: d2c, d2s, d1, and d1ne
-   Instance families equipped with local SSDs: i1, i2, i2g, i2ne, i2gne, i3, and i3g
-   GPU-accelerated compute optimized instance families: vgn5i and gn5
-   FPGA-accelerated compute optimized instance families: f1 and f3
-   ECS Bare Metal Instance families:
    -   ebmgn7, ebmgn6e, ebmgn6v, and ebmgn6i
    -   ebmg6, ebmg5s, ebmg5, ebmc6, ebmc5s, ebmc4, ebmre6p, ebmr6, and ebmr5s
    -   ebmhfg6, ebmhfg5, ebmhfc6, and ebmhfr6
-   SCC instance families: scchfg6, scchfc6, scchfr6, sccg5, scch5, sccgn6e, and sccgn6

## Instance families that support instance type changes

The following tables list instance families that support instance type changes. The instance types of subscription and pay-as-you-go instances can be changed across or within these instance families. For more information about how to change instance types, see [Overview of instance upgrade and downgrade](/intl.en-US/Instance/Change configurations/Overview of instance upgrade and downgrade.md).

**Note:** The available instance types and instance families can be affected by limits such as zones. The information actually displayed in the console prevails. You can also go to the [ECS Instance Types Available for Each Region](https://ecs-buy.aliyun.com/instanceTypes) page to query available instance types.

**Note:**

-   To upgrade an instance of the g6, c6, or r6 instance family to an instance type that belongs to an enhanced sixth-generation instance family \(g6e, c6e, or r6e\) or to a seventh-generation instance family \(hfc7, hfg7, or hfr7\), [submit a ticket](https://workorder-intl.console.aliyun.com/console.htm). You cannot downgrade the instance type of the instance after the upgrade is complete.
-   Instances of the enhanced sixth-generation instance families \(g6e, c6e, and r6e\) and of the seventh-generation instance families \(hfc7, hfg7, and hfr7\) support only enhanced SSDs \(ESSDs\). If an instance has disks of other categories attached, the disks are replaced with ESSDs when you upgrade the instance to an instance type that belongs to a seventh-generation or enhanced sixth-generation instance family. Data on the disks must be manually migrated to the ESSDs. For information about the pricing of ESSDs, see [ECS Pricing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/ecs). |
