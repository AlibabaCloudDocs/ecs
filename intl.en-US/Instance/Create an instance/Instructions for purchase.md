# Instructions for purchase

This topic describes the information that you must understand before you purchase Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances.

## Resource upgrades

For information about how to upgrade the configurations of ECS instances, see [Overview of instance upgrade and downgrade](/intl.en-US/Instance/Change configurations/Overview of instance upgrade and downgrade.md). Before you upgrade the configurations of ECS instances, take note of the following items:

-   Except ECS instances that use local storage, ECS instances can have their CPU and memory resources scaled and their bandwidths upgraded while the instances are running. You can also downgrade the configurations of ECS instances.
-   Typically, a maximum of 16 data disks can be attached to each ECS instance. You cannot reduce the size of a data disk after the data disk is extended.
-   The bandwidth of each ECS instance is measured in Mbit/s and can range from 0 Mbit/s to 200 Mbit/s. You can modify the bandwidth or change the billing method for network usage.
