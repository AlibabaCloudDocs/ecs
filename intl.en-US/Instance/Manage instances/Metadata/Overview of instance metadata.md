# Overview of instance metadata

This topic describes instance metadata and the items that can be obtained from it. You can use instance metadata to flexibly manage or configure instances.

## Introduction

Metadata of an instance includes basic information of the instance in Alibaba Cloud, such as the instance ID, IP address, MAC addresses of network interface controllers \(NICs\) bound to the instance, and operating system type. For more information, see [Retrieve instance metadata](/intl.en-US/Instance/Manage instances/Metadata/Retrieve instance metadata.md).

Instance metadata also includes dynamic items generated after the instance is first started such as system events, instance identifiers, and user data.

## Metadata items

The following table lists basic metadata items that you can obtain from an ECS instance.

## Dynamic O&M-related metadata items

For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Deployment & Maintenance/System events/Overview.md).

## Dynamic identity-related metadata items

Instance identifiers are used to identify and differentiate instances. This can provide trust foundation for application permission control and software activation. Each instance identifier consists of an instance identity document \(document\) and an instance identity signature \(signature\). For more information, see [Instance identity](/intl.en-US/Instance/Manage instances/Instance identity.md).

## Dynamic configuration-related metadata items

User data of instances is implemented based on different types of custom scripts. You can configure user data for an instance when you create the instance. User data allows users to customize instance startup and pass in data to the instance. For example, you can use user data to perform configuration operations such as automatically obtaining software resource packages, enabling services, printing logs, installing dependency packages, and initializing web environments. You can also pass in user data as common data to the instance and reference the data in the instance.

When the instance enters the **Running** state, the system runs the user data scripts by using the administrator or root permission. Then, the system runs the initialization information or the `/etc/init` folder.

For more information, see [Prepare user data](/intl.en-US/Instance/Manage instances/User data/Prepare user data.md).
