# Modify the properties of an instance

After an instance is created, you can modify its name, hostname, and description. If the instance is a pay-as-you-go instance, you can also enable or disable release protection for the instance.

1.  Log on to the [ECS console](https://ecs.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Instances & Images** \> **Instances**.

3.  In the top navigation bar, select a region.

4.  Find the target instance, and choose **More** \> **Instance Settings** \> **Modify Instance Properties** in the **Actions** column.

5.  Modify the properties of the instance.

6.  Click **OK**.

7.  If the hostname of the instance is modified, restart the instance for the new hostname to take effect.

    **Note:** To restart an ECS instance, you must use the ECS console or call the RebootInstance operation. You cannot restart an instance from within the operating system.
