# ModifyInstanceSpec

You can call this operation to change the instance type and public bandwidth of a pay-as-you-go instance.

## Description

For information about SDK for Python used to change resource configurations, see [Query available resources for configuration changes](~~109517~~).

When you call this operation, take note of the following items:

-   You must have no overdue payments in your account.
-   You can change the public bandwidth of an instance only when the instance is in the **Running** \(`Running`\) or **Stopped** \(`Stopped`\) state.
-   Before you change the instance type of a pay-as-you-go instance, you can call the [DescribeResourcesModification](~~66187~~) operation to query the instance types to which you can change.
-   You can change the instance type of an instance only when the instance is in the **Stopped** \(`Stopped`\) state.
-   You can change only the instance type or the public bandwidth each time.
-   As of November 27, 2020, the maximum bandwidth available for you to create ECS instances or change the configurations of ECS instances is subject to the throttling policy in your account. To increase the maximum bandwidth, submit a ticket. The following throttling policies apply:
    -   In a single region, the sum of actual peak bandwidths of all ECS instances that use the pay-by-traffic billing method for network usage cannot exceed 5 Gbit/s.
    -   In a single region, the sum of actual peak bandwidths of all ECS instances that use the pay-by-bandwidth billing method for network usage cannot exceed 50 Gbit/s.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=Ecs&api=ModifyInstanceSpec&type=RPC&version=2014-05-26)

## Request parameters

|Parameter|Type|Required|Example|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-------|-----------|
|Action|String|Yes|ModifyInstanceSpec|The operation that you want to perform. Set the value to ModifyInstanceSpec. |
|InstanceId|String|Yes|i-bp67acfmxazb4p\*\*\*\*|The ID of the instance. |
|InstanceType|String|No|ecs.g6.large|The new instance type. For more information, see [Instance families](~~25378~~) or call the [DescribeInstanceTypes](~~25620~~) operation to query the most recent instance type list. |
|InternetMaxBandwidthOut|Integer|No|10|The maximum outbound public bandwidth. Unit: Mbit/s. Valid values: 0 to 100.

**Note:** When the **pay-by-traffic** billing method for network usage is used, the maximum inbound and outbound bandwidths indicate the upper limits for bandwidths and are used only for reference. When resources are insufficient, these maximum bandwidths cannot be guaranteed. If you want guaranteed bandwidths for your instances, use the **pay-by-bandwidth** billing method for network usage. |
|InternetMaxBandwidthIn|Integer|No|10|The maximum inbound public bandwidth. Unit: Mbit/s. Valid values:

-   When the purchased outbound public bandwidth is less than or equal to 10 Mbit/s, the valid values of InternetMaxBandwidthIn are 1 to 10 and the default value is 10.
-   When the purchased outbound public bandwidth is greater than 10 Mbit/s, the valid values of InternetMaxBandwidthIn are 1 to the `InternetMaxBandwidthOut` value and the default value is the `InternetMaxBandwidthOut` value.

**Note:** When the **pay-by-traffic** billing method for network usage is used, the peak inbound and outbound bandwidths indicate the upper limits for bandwidths and are used only for reference. When resources are insufficient, these maximum bandwidths cannot be guaranteed. If you want guaranteed bandwidths for your instances, use the **pay-by-bandwidth** billing method for network usage. |
|Async|Boolean|No|false|Specifies whether to submit an asynchronous request.

Default value: false. |
|AllowMigrateAcrossZone|Boolean|No|false|Specifies whether to allow cross-cluster instance type upgrades.

Default value: false.

When `AllowMigrateAcrossZone` is set to true and you upgrade the instance configurations based on the returned information, take note of the following items:

Instances in the classic network:

-   For retired instance types, when the configurations of a non-I/O optimized instance is upgraded to those of an I/O optimized instance, the private IP address, disk device names, and software license code of the instance are changed. For information about retired instance types, see [Retired instance types](~~55263~~). For Linux instances, basic disks \(`cloud`\) are identified as xvd\*, such as **xvda** and **xvdb**. Ultra disks \(`cloud_efficiency`\) and standard SSDs \(`cloud_ssd`\) are identified as vd\*, such as **vda** and **vdb**.
-   For instance families available for purchase, when the instance type of an instance is changed, the private IP address of the instance is also changed. For information about instance families available for purchase, see [Instance families](~~25378~~).

Instances in VPCs: For retired instance types, when the configurations of a non-I/O optimized instance is upgraded to those of an I/O optimized instance, the disk device names and software license code of the instance are changed. For information about retired instance types, see [Retired instance types](~~55263~~). For Linux instances, basic disks \(`cloud`\) are identified as xvd\*, such as **xvda** and **xvdb**. Ultra disks \(`cloud_efficiency`\) and standard SSDs \(`cloud_ssd`\) are identified as vd\*, such as **vda** and **vdb**. |
|SystemDisk.Category|String|No|cloud\_ssd|The category of the system disk. This parameter is valid only when you upgrade the configurations of an instance from a retired instance type to an available instance type or from a non-I/O optimized instance to an I/O optimized instance. For more information, see [Retired instance types](~~55263~~) and [Instance families](~~25378~~). Valid values:

-   cloud\_efficiency: ultra disk
-   cloud\_ssd: standard SSD |
|ClientToken|String|No|0c593ea1-3bea-11e9-b96b-88e9fe637760|The client token that is used to ensure the idempotence of the request. You can use the client to generate the value, but you must make sure that it is unique among different requests. The **ClientToken** value must contain only ASCII characters and cannot exceed 64 characters in length. For more information, see [How to ensure idempotence](~~25693~~). |

## Response parameters
