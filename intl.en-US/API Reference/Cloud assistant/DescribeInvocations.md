# DescribeInvocations

You can call this operation to query the execution list and status of Cloud Assistant commands.

## Description

-   After you run a command, it may not succeed or achieve the expected results. You can call this operation to query the actual execution results.
-   You can query the execution information within the past two weeks. A maximum of 100,000 pieces of execution information can be retained.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=Ecs&api=DescribeInvocations&type=RPC&version=2014-05-26)
