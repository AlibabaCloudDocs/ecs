# ResizeDisk

You can call this operation to resize a system disk or data disk.

## Description

**Note:** Before you call this operation, you must check the partition format of the disk. You cannot resize an MBR-formatted disk to greater than or equal to 2 TiB without data loss. To resize an MBR-formatted disk to greater than or equal to 2 TiB in size, we recommend that you create and attach a new data disk with the desired size. Then, you can use the GPT partition format to partition and format the new data disk and copy data from the MBR-formatted data disk to the new GPT-formatted data disk. For more information, see [Resize cloud disks offline](~~44986~~).

-   You can resize the following categories of disks: basic disks \(`cloud`\), ultra disks \(`cloud_efficiency`\), standard SSDs \(`cloud_ssd`\), and enhanced SSDs \(ESSDs\) \(`cloud_essd`\).
-   You cannot resize a disk when a snapshot is being created for the disk.
-   The instance to which the disk to be resized is attached must be in the **Running** \(`Running`\) or **Stopped** \(`Stopped`\) state.
-   After you resize a disk, its partitions and file systems are not changed. You must manually allocate the storage space on the disk after it is resized.

## Debugging

[OpenAPI Explorer automatically calculates the signature value. For your convenience, we recommend that you call this operation in OpenAPI Explorer. OpenAPI Explorer dynamically generates the sample code of the operation for different SDKs.](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=Ecs&api=ResizeDisk&type=RPC&version=2014-05-26)

## Request parameters

|Parameter|Type|Required|Example|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-------|-----------|
|Action|String|Yes|ResizeDisk|The operation that you want to perform. Set the value to ResizeDisk. |
|DiskId|String|Yes|d-bp67acfmxazb4p\*\*\*\*|The ID of the disk. |
|NewSize|Integer|Yes|1900|The new disk capacity. Unit: GiB. Valid values:

-   Ultra disk \(cloud\_efficiency\): 20 to 32768
-   Standard SSD \(cloud\_ssd\): 20 to 32768
-   Enhanced SSD \(cloud\_essd\): 20 to 32768
-   Basic disk \(cloud\): 5 to 2000

The new disk capacity must be greater than the original disk capacity. |
|Type|String|No|offline|The method that you use to resize the disk. Default value: offline. Valid values:

-   offline. After you resize a disk offline, you must restart the instance by using the console or by calling the RebootInstance operation for the resizing operation to take effect. For more information, see [Restart the instance](~~25440~~) and [RebootInstance](~~25502~~).
-   online. After you resize a disk online, the resizing operation takes effect immediately and you do not need to restart the instance. You can resize ultra disks, standard SSDs, and ESSDs online. |
|ClientToken|String|No|123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000|The client token that is used to ensure the idempotence of the request You can use the client to generate the value, but you must ensure that it is unique among different requests. The **ClientToken** value can contain only ASCII characters and cannot exceed 64 characters in length. For more information, see [How to ensure idempotence](~~25693~~). |

## Response parameters

|Parameter|Type|Example|Description|
