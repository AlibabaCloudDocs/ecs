# How to make a request

This section is applicable to users who make a GET request over HTTP or HTTPS by sending a URL.

If you prefer using [SDK](https://next.api.aliyun.com/api-tools/sdk/Ecs?version=2014-05-26), Alibaba Cloud CLI, or [OpenAPI Explorer](https://api.aliyun.com/), skip this section.

The request URL consists of different parameters and has a fixed syntax. For more information, see [Request structure](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Getting started/Request syntax.md). The URL contains common request parameters, your signature, and operation-specific parameters. For more information, see [Common parameters](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Getting started/Common parameters.md) and [Digital signature](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Getting started/Request signatures.md). URL request examples are available for each API operation. These URL examples are not encoded so that they are easy to read. You must encode the URL before making a request. A result is returned to you after the authentication process is complete based on your signature. For more information, see [Responses](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Getting started/Responses.md). Response parameters are returned if the call is successful, whereas an error message is returned if the call fails. You can troubleshoot issues based on the common error codes and operation-specific error codes.

**Note:** We recommend that you use SDK to call operations and manage resources, which avoids manual authentication.
